%----------------------------------------------
% Please read the in-file brief Instructions below 
% or More detailed Instructions in sample file (Instructions.tex)
% to learn how to use this Latex template.
% 
% Then go through from current line number 155 to line 205
% to fill in the details about yourself, course, your dissertation, etc. 
%
% Notes and sample files:
% "acronyms.tex": a sample file where you define your abbreviations.
% ------------
% 
% ####---- Brief in-file Instructions ----####
% ----Preparation steps: 
% (i)  Download the zipped Latex template file into your disk or your university's home space on U disk,
% (ii) Unzip all the files into your working folder, such as \Dissertation. 
% (ii) Change/replace/fill some places in this "DissertationTemplateV.tex" file (where V is the version number, e.g. 5)  to suit your need:
% 	such as, Your course, year, dissertation title, your name, markers, etc.
%
%% Then you can follow the instructions (not necessarily in that order) to write your dissertation. 
%   
%% 1. Write your abstract in a provided sample tex file: "Abstract.tex"
%% 2. Write your acknowledgement in a provided sample tex file: "Acknowledgement.tex"  
%    Note: Both tex files are already included in the zipped file. 
%
%% 3. Write each chapter in a separate tex file and name them e.g. Ch1.tex, Ch2.tex, etc. 
% and then use "include" to include them as shown in this example.
% 
%% 4. Citation styles: package "natbib" is used for making references.
%   you should replace the bib file - xbib, with your own bib file
%   at the END of this template file, i.e.   
%   \bibliography{xbib} % use your own bib file 
%   Then, you can use the following two commands 
%   to cite your reference, pending on how it is use. 
%   (i) Use Command "\citep{...}" to produce the style: (Authors, year)
%   (ii) Use Command "\citet{...}" to produce the style: Authors (year)
%
%#### 
% If you wish to produce a list of abbreviations/acronyms 
% that are used in your dissertation, you must read notes 5-8 below. 
%
%% 5. Define abbreviations or acronyms
% 	you can use the given sample file "acronyms.tex" 
% 	to define your abbreviations or acronyms, and 
% 	some examples are already defined in that file.
% 	After you have defined them, (you can add any new items anytime you like), 
% 	save it in the same folder of your dissertation main tex file
% 	as it is included by using "include{acronyms}" in this file later.
% 	Note: if you use any other file name, change it in "\inlcude{yourFilename}. 
%
%% 6. Using the defined abbreviations/acronyms
%   In file "IntrsuctionsV.tex", I explain and show how to use defined acronyms in your tex file.  
%
%% 7. Generate a List of Abbreviations(LOA)
%  You must issue command "Makeglossaries" to produce few more auxiliary files 
%   e.g. xxxx.acr, and/or .glo, and/or .gls, etc. in order to produce LOA 
%   so, is you use TexStudio, Click "Tools" and choose "Makeglossaries"
%
%% 8. Don't want to have a list of Abbreviations
%  use command "\nolistofabbs", by uncomment it in later part  
%  then LOA will not be generated and not appear in the TOC. 
%  note: you may have to run "Build and View" twice to get the intended result.
%        first run to remove/get the acutal list of abbreviation
%		 second run to remove/get the list appearing on TOC.   
% 
%% 9. Using footnote. (% wjw, added this note on 11/09/2015)
%	If you want to use footnotes in any chapters of your dissertation, 
%	you can use command \footnote{your footnote text} in where you want.
% 	The footnotes are numbered automatically and continuously within a CHAPTER.   
%   
% 10. Added the confidentiality statement on 24/03/2020.
